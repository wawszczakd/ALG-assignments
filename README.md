# ALG Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to assignments from the course
"Algorithmics".

## Overview

The course is about theoretical algorithms. There were four assignments in
total, three of which were about theoretical problems, and one was a programming
assignment. Both problem statements and solutions are in Polish and are provided
in PDF file format generated using LaTeX.

## Assignment Topics

The assignments cover the following topics:

1. Flows and cuts in a graph
2. Matching in a bipartite graph, linear programs
3. NP-completeness, approximation
4. Parameterized algorithms

Solutions can be found in the respective assignment directories.
